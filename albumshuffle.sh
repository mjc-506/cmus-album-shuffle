# status-display
#
# Usage:
#   in cmus command ":set status_display_program=status-display"
#
# This scripts is executed by cmus when status changes:
#   cmus-status-display key1 val1 key2 val2 ...
#
# All keys contain only chars a-z. Values are UTF-8 strings.
#
# Keys: status file url artist album discnumber tracknumber title date
#   - status (stopped, playing, paused) is always given
#   - file or url is given only if track is 'loaded' in cmus
#   - other keys/values are given only if they are available
#
#
# This script will be called by cmus upon every status change, and
# will call cmus-remote to implement a hacky 'album shuffle' mode!
